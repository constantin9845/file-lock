## To Do


- Test edge cases when modifying AD files (whitespace, dots, substrings)

- Add input fix for AD input: newline must be eaten before std::getline().

- Add feedback messages for user (state of program)


## Optimize

- Authentication very slow -> only with hw accel.
- Other, faster method for pure software implementation?

- Can write to file and GMAC be multithreaded?

- add docs.

## Additions

-- check for very large input size.
-- duplicate AD txt files in dir encryption
-- add option to auto detect AD and tagL: for dir decryption : some yes some no.
