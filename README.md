## To Do

- segmentation fault, run gdb again. likely multiplication


## Optimize

- Authentication very slow - def needs hw function
- Auth. consumer small amount of conpute, should run parallel with encryption?

- Can write to file and auth be multithreaded?

- add docs.

## Additions

-- check for very large input size.
-- duplicate AD txt files in dir encryption
-- add option to auto detect AD and tagL: for dir decryption : some yes some no.
-- test file for timing
