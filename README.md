## To Do

### Optimization: 

- memcpy and XOR --> __mm__xor_si128
- check for unecessary I/O --> disk is overloaded during process : store im RAM? start processing straight away, no re-reading from buffer.
- 70mb/s ---> min 500mb/s



- add docs.

## Additions

-- check for very large input size.
-- duplicate AD txt files in dir encryption
-- add option to auto detect AD and tagL: for dir decryption : some yes some no.
-- test file for timing
