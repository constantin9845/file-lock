## To Do

### Optimization: 

- bottleneck: buffer writing to file (+95% of total time): 
-       Different write methods perform same (1GB - 12s)
-       Need concurrent write with threads.
-       

- MAC/LINUX hardware aes

- add docs.

## Additions

-- check for very large input size.
-- duplicate AD txt files in dir encryption
-- add option to auto detect AD and tagL: for dir decryption : some yes some no.
-- test file for timing
